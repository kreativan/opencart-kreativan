## How to install

Don't dowload the repo and try to install it, it will not work! Download the release, because zip file needs to be names as '*.ocmod.zip'

* Do to the opencart directory restrictions (a bug?), need to install this extension first:    
  https://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=marketplace/extension/info&extension_id=33410
* Go to *Extensions -> Modifications* and refresh. 
* Upload kreativan-oc-framework.ocmod.zip 
* At this point if you visit store front-end, you will get an error, dont worry, this is do to the custom files and modifications. Need to install and activate the theme, so continue...
* Go to *Extensions -> Modifications* and refresh.
* Go to *Extensions -> Extensions* and select extension type *Themes*
* Install and enable *Kreativan Framework*
* Go to *System -> Settings -> Your Store* and select *Kreativan Framework* theme.
* Go to *System -> Users -> User Groups* and add acceess and modify permissions for the custom pages. Just click 'Select All' and save :)
